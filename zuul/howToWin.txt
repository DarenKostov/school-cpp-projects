How do you win?


write as is,
a colon is a colon key press,
a period is a period key press,
a "k" is a k key press, 
a "K" is Shift and a k key press

...with the xception of
dont press Enter on a new line
when I put something in `` I want you to press a key or key combination
when I put something in () on a new line I want you to perfom an action DO NOT PRESS ENTER IN THAT CASE

Also be aware I use vim in this guide, you can use emacs, but the key strokes would be different

===================== starts now:
`Enter`
`Enter`
`Enter`
`Enter`
`Enter`
`Enter`
`Enter`
`Enter`
`Enter`
`Enter`

c /root/cd`Enter`
p 0 /bin/`Enter`
cd tmp`Enter`
cat 5$|D-7Xt`Enter`
(select the output, should look like something like "Network53515056")
cd /etc`Enter`
mkdir netman`Enter`
cd netman`Enter`
mkdir connections`Enter`
cd connections`Enter`
touch `Shift+Insert`.conf`Enter`
vim `Shift+Insert`.conf`Enter`
i[connection]`Enter`
id=`Shift+Insert``Enter`
`Enter`
[security]`Enter`
pass=`Esc`:wq`Enter`
cat /home/Desktop/memes/password-meme.txt`Enter`
vim `Shift+Insert`.conf
(select the string between "network might be " and " but I" from the previous command output, should be something like "}i*b75^+T,<T`ebmoEr1")
`Enter`
i`Left Arrow``Shift+Insert``Esc`:wq`Enter`
cat /etc/con.conf`Enter`
(select the line after "[Internal Computers]", without including the end line, shoud look like "tg8,q;`d")
grep '`Shift+Insert`' /sys/connections/list1.txt`Enter`
(go to line 60 of this guide if any out put)
grep '`Shift+Insert`' /sys/connections/list2.txt`Enter`
(go to line 60 of this guide if any out put)
grep '`Shift+Insert`' /sys/connections/list3.txt`Enter`
(go to line 60 of this guide if any out put)
grep '`Shift+Insert`' /sys/connections/list4.txt`Enter`
(select the ip adress that is after ": ", should look like "75.189.233.215")
ssh `Shift+Insert``Enter`
vim /opt/code.code`Enter`
7dw`End`5dbd`Space`:wq`Enter
=================== end now

You won
You can still keep playing, make files, folders, fill your ram!

Here is how to do it with just the commands, previous rules dont apply here except the () and
anything in <> is a varibale or information like a password or a name

================== starts now:

c /root/cd
p 0 /bin/
cd tmp
cat 5$|D-7Xt
(remember the output, that is the name of the network)

cd /etc
mkdir netman
cd netman
mkdir connections
cd connections

cat /home/Desktop/memes/password-meme.txt
(remeber the output, the password is somehwer in it)



touch <the name of the network>.conf
(I use vim here but you can use emacs, nano, micro, or even something like eclipse (for eclipse you gotta do "editor eclipse <file name>"))
vim <the file you just created>
(put this in the file, there is endline at the end, the starts)
(SOF)
[connection]
id=<name of network>

[security]`
pass=<password of network>

(EOF)

cat /etc/con.conf`Enter`
(remeber the output it has the name of the devise you want to ssh into)

grep '<name of device>' /sys/connections/list1.txt
(go to line 115 of this guide if any out put)
grep '<name of device>' /sys/connections/list2.txt
(go to line 115 of this guide if any out put)
grep '<name of device>' /sys/connections/list3.txt
(go to line 115 of this guide if any out put)
grep '<name of device>' /sys/connections/list4.txt

(remember the output, it contains the ip adress you want to ssh into)

ssh <ip adress>

(again use whatever editor you want)
vim /opt/code.code
(leave only number in the file, it should end with an endline as well)

============== end now

make sure to use "help" and "man" if you don't know how to use a command
