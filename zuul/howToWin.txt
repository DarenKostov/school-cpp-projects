How do you win?

when I put something in {} on a new line I want you to perform an action

write as is,
a colon is a colon key press,
a period is a period key press,
a "k" is a k key press, 
a "K" is Shift and a k key press

...with the xception of
dont press Enter on a new line
when I put something in `` I want you to press a key or key combination
when I put something in () on a new line I want you to perfom an action DO NOT PRESS ENTER IN THAT CASE

Also be aware I use vim in this guide, you can use emacs, but the key strokes would be different
